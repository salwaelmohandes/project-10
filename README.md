# project-10
I used React to create a client for my existing school database REST API (that I created in project 9).
The full stack application provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses 
users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, 
updating and deleting courses in the database.

In addition, the project require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database. 

I used my knowledge of React, JSX, React Router, React Context API, and Create React App.

After using the Create React App tool to set up my initial project, 
I used JavaScript and JSX to build out the components for my application in a modular fashion.
I used React Router to set up your routes.
I used the Fetch API to fetch data from my REST API.
I allowed users to sign up and use basic authentication to support users signing in.
